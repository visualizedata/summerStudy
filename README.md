### Coding

**[Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)**
We will use these languages to markup documents and style content. This course focuses on creating websites, which we will not be doing. Therefore, you should give this course a cursory review, focusing mostly on the fundamentals of marking up content with HTML and applying style rules with CSS. You should complete this course if you have very little or no exposure to HTML and CSS. 
*Estimated time to complete: 7 hours*

**[Working knowledge of the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)**
JavaScript is the core language used in the program and this course deserves careful, thorough study. We recommend this course to everyone, even those with experience using JavaScript. 
*Estimated time to complete: 10 hours.*

**[A general understanding of how Git and GitHub can be used for version control and to manage workflow on coding projects](https://youtu.be/DVDLoe_2MBc)**
This video provides a basic overview of Git and GitHub, which is all you need for now. We will offer detailed workshops and instruction at the beginning of the fall semester. You should watch this video only if you have never used Git/GibHub. 
*Estimated time to complete: 40 minutes.*

**A general understanding of [the Processing language](http://hello.processing.org/) and [a popular JavaScript interpretation](http://hello.p5js.org/)**
